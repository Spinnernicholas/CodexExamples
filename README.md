# CodexExamples
Just some interesting examples from OpenAI's Codex Model

Examples are copied straight out of the Codex JavaScript Sandbox without modification.

Cool Examples:
- CreatingPlayingCards.js - Displays 10 random playing cards with minimal design input
- SolarSystemAttempt2.js - Very cool animated sun, earth, and moon
- SimplePhysicsSim.1.js - Two Inputs created cool particle simulation. Clicking the mouse adds particles

WTF:
- SolarSystemAttempt1.js - Crazy looking animation generated based on a single sentence
